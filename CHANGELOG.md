# Changelog

All notable changes to independently released TAF skills are recorded here.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- One structured context-discovery choice when a request omits Jira and GitHub targets.
- Exact Jira target entry and bounded current-branch PR discovery before target-specific read consent.

### Changed

- Explicit platform targets and explicit local-only requests skip context discovery.
- Jira and GitHub may be selected together while local-only remains mutually exclusive.

### Security

- Context discovery performs no adapter or network access, and platform reads still require session-scoped consent.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- Preflight for explicitly supplied Jira issue and GitHub PR targets before diff collection.
- Structured consent choices when supported, with equivalent numbered fallback.
- One session-scoped Jira permission for connection verification and bounded issue fields.
- Deterministic agent-specific re-install/update commands and Claude marketplace auto-update guidance.

### Changed

- Authorized platform intent and acceptance criteria now participate in the first and only handoff synthesis.
- Platform decline or read failure now continues to a complete diff-only report.

### Security

- Platform content remains untrusted evidence, and every external comment still requires exact target and exact draft confirmation.
